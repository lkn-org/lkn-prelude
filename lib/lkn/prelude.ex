defmodule Lkn.Prelude do
  @moduledoc """
  An opinionated Prelude for the [lkn project](http://lkn.ist).

  It is designed to fit lkn needs, but if it brings you what you need,
  feel free to use it.

  ## Guide

  Every module of this package is in the `Lkn.Prelude` namespace to
  avoid name collision. If one want to adopt our opinionated point of
  view, all she has to do is to add the following line to her code:

      use Lkn.Prelude

  After that, the modules are aliased and required, which means they
  can be used painlessly.

  ## Preludeâ€™s Principles

  ### Opaque data-structures and macro-based pattern matching

  In Elixir, it is not rare to see the most common data structure
  defined as tuples. For instance, a computation that may or may not
  return a result will effectively return `{ :ok, val } | :error`. As
  a consequence, the caller will have to match the result:

      case res do
        {:ok, val} ->
          # ...
        _ ->
          # ...
        end

  From our perspective, it brings several issues. The main one is
  inconsistency. Some code might return `{:ok, val}` in case of
  success where other would return `{:some, val}`. Another is that it
  makes it harder to change the data structure implementation. For
  instance, what if one want to return a structure rather than a
  tuple, in order to implement the `Enumerable` protocol?

  This package takes another path. The data structure typespecs are
  opaque and the constructors are implemented as macros. The main
  benefit is macros can be used to match a value.

      case res do
        Option.some(x) ->
          # ...
        Option.nothing() ->
          # ...
      end

  ### Parameterized Typespecs

  Most of the time, the data structure typespecs in Elixir are not
  parameterized by the type of the content. In this package, they
  are. In addition, the data structure modules define two types: `a`
  and `b` which are aliases to `any`. From dialyzer point of view,
  they bring no additional information and mixing them does not raise
  any warning. However, from a developer point of view, it can bring
  more information about the real behaviour of a function:

  That is, we believe `@spec map(t(a), (a -> b)) :: t(b)` is more
  expressive and useful than `@spec map(t(any), (any -> any)) ::
  t(any)` or `@spec map(t, (any -> any)) :: t`.
